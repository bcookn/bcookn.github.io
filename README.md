This project evaluates GHG emissions on a neighborhood-level. I am primarily interested in differences in emissions between high income neighborhoods and low income neighborhoods. To do this, I will be utilizing Subclassification and Matching via K-Nearest Neighbors to control for the difference in means and estimate average treatment effects.
