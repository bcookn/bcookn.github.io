### Evaluating GHG Emissions by Neighborhood Wealth
#### *Overview*

> This project evaluates GHG emissions by on a neighborhood-level. I am primarily interested in differences in emission between high income neighborhoods and low income neighborhoods. I think it’ll be interesting to a lot of folks since GHG emissions affect all of us, and we all contribute to the overall carbon footprint. On top of that, theres a bunch of policy that’s related to GHG emissions such as AB 32, which requires California to lower its carbon emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, SB-100 which requires california to get to 100% renewable energy by 2045, and even policy on a more granular level that affects our day-to-day such as the NEM 3 proposal. Also depending on my results I think it could help shine a light on some of the inefficient technology that’s typically found in low-income communities due to lack of modernization, so maybe it could inspire policymakers to provide government funding on things like solar PV, battery storages, and heat pumps for low income communities.
