### Evaluating GHG Emissions by Neighborhood Wealth

#### Overview
*"The 1 percent could emit 30 times more than the poorest 50 percent and 175 times more than the poorest 10 percent"*

> -- Oxford Media Briefing, 2015

<br> This project evaluates GHG emissions on a neighborhood-level. I am primarily interested in differences in emissions between high income neighborhoods and low income neighborhoods. To do this, I will be utilizing subclassification and matching via k-nearest neighbors to control for the differences in means and estimate average treatment effects.
